Feature engineering, including price per minimum night, availability categories, and neighborhood average prices, provides actionable insights for pricing strategy, market segmentation, and identifying profitable rental opportunities. Visualizations (bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps, and scatterplots) effectively communicate patterns and trends across boroughs, room types, and listing activity.
