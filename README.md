Explored 2019 NYC Airbnb listings to reveal pricing trends, popular neighborhoods, and active rental patterns. Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate premium listings, while Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island offer more affordable options. Entire homes/apartments are consistently the priciest, whereas private and shared rooms cater to budget-conscious travelers. High-review listings highlight in-demand rentals, and low-availability, above-average price listings indicate short-term premium opportunities. Correlation analysis shows that number of reviews strongly aligns with reviews per month, while price alone does not guarantee booking activity. Feature engineering, including price per minimum night, availability categories, and neighborhood average prices, provides actionable insights for pricing strategy, market segmentation, and identifying profitable rental opportunities. Visualizations (bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps, and scatterplots) effectively communicate patterns and trends across boroughs, room types, and listing activity.
